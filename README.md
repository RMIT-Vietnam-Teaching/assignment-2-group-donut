## üí° Why I Made This App
Traditional inspection workflows at Phuong Hai company involved **manual note-taking, delayed reporting, and scattered communication**.  
This app solves these issues by:
- Centralizing all inspection data in one place.
- Reducing paperwork and manual errors.
- Enabling supervisors to **monitor tasks, assign jobs, and review reports instantly**.



## üéØ What I Learned
- Applying **Android Jetpack components** (ViewModel, LiveData, WorkManager).
- Handling **offline-first architecture** with background sync.
- Managing **team collaboration** with version control (Git & GitHub).
- Writing **clean, maintainable code** with dependency injection (Hilt).
- Understanding the challenges of building **real-world mobile apps** for businesses.

## üöÄ Features
- User authentication with role-based access (Supervisor / Inspector)
- Real-time messaging between Supervisor and Inspector
- Offline mode with background data synchronization
- Machine learning to auto-generate inspection descriptions from uploaded images
- Push notifications for new tasks and status updates 
- Inspection form with photo upload & notes
- Create inspection reports based on assigned tasks 
- Task assignment and management
- Review reports with option to accept or reject submissions
- Dashboard to monitor progress across branches
- Manage report history and export approved reports as PDF
- Compose UI and unit testing

- **ML Kit Image Labeling**: auto-suggests labels from attached images.
- **Offline support**: reports/tasks stored in Room ‚Üí **auto-synced** to Firestore/Storage when online.
- **Report history**: view past reports with status (**PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED**) and supervisor notes.

- Manage **notifications** and **chat** with Inspectors.
- Filter by **Branch**, **Priority**, or time.

### System/Platform
- **Network monitor + Foreground service**: triggers **WorkManager sync**.
- **FileProvider** for external file sharing (PDF/images).
- **PDF export** with iText7 (note license restrictions).

---

## 3) Architecture & Folder Structure
### Model
- **Clean Architecture + MVVM**
  - **Presentation**: Compose screens + ViewModels
  - **Domain**: models, repositories, use cases
  - **Data**: repositories (Firebase/Room), local DB, remote Firestore/Storage/Realtime
  - **Core**: DI (Hilt), networking, sync, file storage

### Important Folders
```
app/src/main/java/com/phuonghai/inspection/
‚îú‚îÄ InspectionApp.kt              # @HiltAndroidApp entry point, network listener
‚îú‚îÄ MainActivity.kt / MainViewModel.kt
‚îú‚îÄ core/ (di, network, storage, sync)
‚îú‚îÄ data/ (local Room, repositories, remote Firebase)
‚îú‚îÄ domain/ (model, repository interfaces, use cases)
‚îú‚îÄ presentation/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ auth (PhoneLogin, OTP, Splash)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ navigation (NavHost + bottom bars for roles)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ inspector (dashboard, report, history, notifications, tasks, chat)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ supervisor (dashboard, map, history, report, tasks, chat)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ theme
‚îî‚îÄ res/xml (backup rules, file_paths, etc.)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è One file (`SupervisorMapScreen.kt`) uses package `com.donut.assignment2...` instead of `com.phuonghai.inspection...`. Should be fixed to avoid build errors.

---

## 4) Environment Setup
Since only `app/` is provided, two options:

### Option A ‚Äì Use Android Studio (recommended)
1. Install Android Studio **Ladybug 2024.2.1+**.
2. Create a new project ‚Üí remove its `app/` ‚Üí replace with this `app/` folder.
3. Add to `settings.gradle.kts`:
   ```kotlin
   include(":app")
   ```
4. Ensure root `build.gradle.kts` has correct plugin/versions (AGP, Kotlin, Hilt).
5. Sync Gradle ‚Üí build.

### Option B ‚Äì Minimal Gradle setup
Add root `settings.gradle.kts` and `build.gradle.kts` with proper plugin versions.

---

## 5) Secrets & Config
- **Firebase**: requires `google-services.json` in `app/`. Don‚Äôt commit this file.
- **Google Maps API key**: move from `AndroidManifest.xml` ‚Üí `local.properties` + `manifestPlaceholders`.
- **Permissions**: INTERNET, NETWORK_STATE, FINE_LOCATION, CAMERA, STORAGE.

---

## 6) How to Run
- Run on device/emulator with **Google Play services**.
- Login flow: enter phone ‚Üí receive OTP ‚Üí verify ‚Üí redirect to Inspector/Supervisor dashboard based on Firestore role.

  Account:
- Supervisor Account: Phone: 123456789, OTP: 123456
