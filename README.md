## üí° Why Our Team Made This App
At Phuong Hai company, traditional inspection workflows often relied on manual note-taking, delayed reporting, and fragmented communication, which slowed down operations and created unnecessary risks.
We wanted to change that by building an app that:

- Centralizes all inspection data into a single, reliable platform.

- Reduces paperwork, improves accuracy, and minimizes human errors.

- Enables supervisors to monitor tasks, assign jobs, and review reports instantly.

- Strengthens collaboration between inspectors and supervisors through real-time messaging and notifications.

- Ultimately, our goal was to streamline the inspection process, save time for employees, and help the company make faster, better-informed decisions.



## üéØ What We Learned Along The Way
- Applying Android Jetpack components such as ViewModel, LiveData, and WorkManager.
- Designing an offline-first architecture with background synchronization.
- Collaborating effectively using version control tools (Git & GitHub).
- Writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code with dependency injection (Hilt).
- Gaining insights into the challenges of building business-oriented mobile applications.

### For **Inspector**
- Login with **phone number + OTP (Firebase Phone Auth)**.
- Dashboard: view **assigned tasks**, filter by branch/priority.
- **Create Report**: title, description, inspection type (*Electrical, Fire Safety, Structural, Food Hygiene, Environmental, Machinery*), score, location (lat/lng + address), photos/videos.
- **ML Kit Image Labeling**: auto-suggests labels from attached images.
- **Offline support**: reports/tasks stored in Room ‚Üí **auto-synced** to Firestore/Storage when online.
- **Report history**: view past reports with status (**PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED**) and supervisor notes.
- **1‚Äì1 Chat** with Supervisor, plus **notifications** for updates.

### For **Supervisor**
- Dashboard + **Google Maps view** of report locations.
- Review reports: update status **ASSIGN / IN_PROGRESS / COMPLETED / CANCELLED / OVERDUE** (Task) and **PASSED/FAILED/NEEDS_ATTENTION** (Report).
- Manage **notifications** and **chat** with Inspectors.
- Filter by **Branch**, **Priority**, or time.

### System/Platform

## 3) Architecture & Folder Structure
### Model
- **Clean Architecture + MVVM**
  - **Presentation**: Compose screens + ViewModels
  - **Domain**: models, repositories, use cases
  - **Data**: repositories (Firebase/Room), local DB, remote Firestore/Storage/Realtime
  - **Core**: DI (Hilt), networking, sync, file storage

### Important Folders
```
app/src/main/java/com/phuonghai/inspection/
‚îú‚îÄ InspectionApp.kt              # @HiltAndroidApp entry point, network listener
‚îú‚îÄ MainActivity.kt / MainViewModel.kt
‚îú‚îÄ core/ (di, network, storage, sync)
‚îú‚îÄ data/ (local Room, repositories, remote Firebase)
‚îú‚îÄ domain/ (model, repository interfaces, use cases)
‚îú‚îÄ presentation/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ auth (PhoneLogin, OTP, Splash)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ navigation (NavHost + bottom bars for roles)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ inspector (dashboard, report, history, notifications, tasks, chat)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ supervisor (dashboard, map, history, report, tasks, chat)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ theme
‚îî‚îÄ res/xml (backup rules, file_paths, etc.)
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è One file (`SupervisorMapScreen.kt`) uses package `com.donut.assignment2...` instead of `com.phuonghai.inspection...`. Should be fixed to avoid build errors.

## 4) Secrets & Config
- **Firebase**: requires `google-services.json` in `app/`. Don‚Äôt commit this file.
- **Google Maps API key**: move from `AndroidManifest.xml` ‚Üí `local.properties` + `manifestPlaceholders`.
- **Permissions**: INTERNET, NETWORK_STATE, FINE_LOCATION, CAMERA, STORAGE.

## 5) How to Run
- Run on device/emulator with **Google Play services**.
- Login flow: enter phone ‚Üí receive OTP ‚Üí verify ‚Üí redirect to Inspector/Supervisor dashboard based on Firestore role.

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RMIT-Vietnam-Teaching/assignment-2-group-donut
   ```

## 7) Data Models (simplified)
```kotlin
data class User(uId: String, fullName: String, phoneNumber: String, role: UserRole)

data class Task(taskId: String, title: String, description: String, priority: Priority, status: TaskStatus)

data class Report(reportId: String, inspectorId: String, taskId: String,
                  title: String, description: String, type: InspectionType,
                  lat: String, lng: String, address: String, score: Int?,
                  responseStatus: ResponseStatus, imageUrl: String?)
```

---

## 8) Common Issues
- Wrong package ‚Üí fix `SupervisorMapScreen.kt`.
- AGP/Kotlin mismatch ‚Üí adjust root `build.gradle.kts` or update Studio.
- Missing Compose BOM/`libs.versions.toml` ‚Üí add or replace aliases with direct versions.
- Maps API key empty ‚Üí app crashes ‚Üí use manifestPlaceholders.
- Storage permissions (use Scoped Storage for Android 10+).
