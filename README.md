# 📱 Phuong Hai Field Inspection Application

An Android mobile application designed to enhance the workflow between **supervisors** and **inspectors** in Phuong Hai company, enabling faster and centralized data management for inspections.

---

## 📖 Overview
The **Field Inspection App** was developed as a group project for my **Mobile Development** course at **RMIT University**.  
It streamlines inspection reporting by providing inspectors with a mobile-first solution to collect, manage, and share data with supervisors in real time.

- Supervisor Account: Phone: 123456789, OTP: 123456
- Inspector Account: Phone: 223456789, OTP: 123456

## 💡 Why I Made This App
Traditional inspection workflows at Phuong Hai company involved **manual note-taking, delayed reporting, and scattered communication**.  
This app solves these issues by:
- Centralizing all inspection data in one place.
- Reducing paperwork and manual errors.
- Enabling supervisors to **monitor tasks, assign jobs, and review reports instantly**.
